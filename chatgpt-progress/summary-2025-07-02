# 📝 Project Summary — `pug-ts-check`  
**Date: 2025-07-02**  

## ✅ Overview  
- Built a CLI tool (`pug-ts-check`) to type-check Pug templates against TypeScript contracts.  
- Parses `//@import` and `//@expect` comments to build a virtual TypeScript “contract” type.  
- Precompiles the Pug template to an AST.  
- Generates equivalent TypeScript code to validate the contract.  
- Uses `ts-morph` to type-check the generated TypeScript.  
- Supports watching a directory with `chokidar` (v4) for live-rechecking on file changes.  
- Supports line-mapping from generated TypeScript back to original Pug lines.  
- Project path can be overridden with `--projectPath`.  
- Integrated logging levels (`info`, `debug`, `silent`) for cleaner CLI output.

## ✅ Technical Highlights  

- **Contract Parsing**  
  - Detects `//@import` and `//@expect` blocks  
  - Writes a temporary `.tmp/VirtualExpectFile.ts`  
  - Resolves relative imports for validation  
  - Throws errors on invalid or duplicate `//@expect` blocks  

- **Pug Precompile + TypeScript Generation**  
  - Walks Pug AST  
  - Generates TypeScript with correct locals destructuring  
  - Supports mixins, loops, conditionals  
  - Preserves line numbers via a `lineMap`  
  - Pretty-prints with indentation  
  - Handles nested blocks and `if` conditions  

- **Type Checking**  
  - Uses `ts-morph` on the generated `.tmp/VirtualGeneratedFile.ts`  
  - Maps TypeScript errors back to the Pug source  
  - Supports custom project `tsconfig.json`  
  - Allows controlling `lib` options if needed  
  - Type errors shown with friendly messages  

- **Watcher**  
  - Uses chokidar v4  
  - Because chokidar v4 dropped glob patterns, replaced it with:  
    ```js
    chokidar.watch(resolved, {
      ignored: (filePath, stats) => stats?.isFile() ? !filePath.endsWith(".pug") : false,
    });
    ```
  - `--watch` mode will re-run the type-check on any detected changes  
  - Logs `add`, `change`, and `unlink` events

## ✅ Lessons & Issues Encountered  

- Pug mixins require carefully stripping TypeScript type annotations to avoid runtime errors  
- `ts-morph` sees only what is in the `tsconfig`, so correct project scoping is essential  
- Needed to use `skipAddingFilesFromTsConfig` to avoid pulling in the entire repo  
- The line map logic required carefully tracking Pug AST lines to TypeScript output  
- Chokidar v4 no longer supports globs directly, which was an important migration step  
- Chrome browser slowed down after very long ChatGPT threads (no specific solution yet from OpenAI — a **new chat** is best after long sessions)  

---

## ✅ Next Ideas  

- Possibly add a `--fix` option to auto-insert missing `//@expect`  
- Consider a VSCode extension integration  
- Add support for multi-root monorepos  
- Explore caching to speed up repeated checks  
- Better test coverage for deeply nested Pug features

## ✅ Example Commands  

```bash
npx tsx src/cli/pug-ts-check.ts ./tests/example-test-project/pug --watch --projectPath ./tests/example-test-project
```

**Great work pushing this forward — let’s continue in a new chat next time!** 🚀
