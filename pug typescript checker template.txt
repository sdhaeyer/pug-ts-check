well i am focussing on the architectur. No the implementatino, i'm asuming this will work. 

So i was thinking . e.g., 

top line off a pug has a line 
// expects { obj:Obj, user: User, cart?:Cart}

- this should allow for the renderer at time to see what is is missing. 
- or what is given and isn 't used.

- next, inline we could check if the methods used are available on the object. 

I'm not sure if the e.g. pug-parser has a list off al the javascript that is used ... 
or how to go about that. 

- Also there is the other thing off finding the types. so indeed we could go from a sep file side car, a standard sharefile, but i am wondering can we import ... , and would that not be nice. 

- another thing we want pug to still work if the typescript is not installed. (offcourse) (or atlease for starters) 

- so idee we could use import syntax, similar to node/typescript.
 //@ import {User, Obj, Cart} from '../models/all/models.ts'  // example import.

- so further idee we would write the lines as starting with //@ statement

- then first, we would parse the file. 
 -> find expect or cannot find expects
 -> check the imports ... can or can not find the import , only accept types. 
 -> in the expect check if we can find the types ... or error.
 -> (furter to checking (todo)) Let's call theis stepB
- future we can have a //@ strict

- Now like this we can check a file if it is ok. (step A only for starters), 

- so we can check a file if it is ok. independend off thez system or who is using it wich is nice.

Secondly when express is using the pug renderen and get's a pug file, we gan check if it gets what it is expecting. 

- Two problems here. 

- but let first get in there and try we'll see them arise. 

So on moment off rendering, we are passing the locals object, or maybe joined with a global object? 
- if we start with the local object, we heva to check if the object is compatible with what is expected. 

- we here have a problem if the pug file says, i'm expecting a user:User, where user is the name, and User the type, which is the type wich he get's from the import, if we are passing a User object how do we now both are speaking about the same User type. 

- for compilation of our ts files we use tsconfig, i'm wondering, or question?, does this parse you speak off probabbly has a list of types plus also where they are defined , and we could then maybe compare if it comes from the same file. 

- anyhows a type should only be declared at one place, and we should use that, so it seems obvious, not totally, that a type has a location, so those can be compared, i'm just finding it a bit ... i don't know.i think it's fine. 

But so we have a run time thing or a connection thing express and pug, and a independent thing. I think that is nice to keep. 

once we couple, we'll have to see if it is the same... but so how do we couple.

somewhere, in the render function, we have to go and get the pug file, and see what it expects. 

So with every render, (we have to get this from a tree?) we go to the pug file, see what its expects and see if it is fine... i dont know about speed. 

so two things. 

Maybe we have some kind off pug watcher ... wich can on save check the pug file., but also then (run to the render objects... ?) 

I seem to be using tsx for the backend and tsc --watch for the frontend. 
-? Do we add a dev:pug ...? 

- do we update the tsx? or have somekind off plugin, mabe not no ? 

Ok, so, A checkSimple (independend (sub a en b)) , B run over the renderes ( i have no idee how this would work)

- we will need a watch mode , if this is fast enough. 

so on ts change rn over the renderes, on pug change run over the pug and over the renders. 

I need names. you probabbly have some for that.

... some chatgpt answer 


and then i again ... 


what is a DSL? , plus, the naming got a bit to far. I need a name, for, how do you call it to check if the file it self is 'ok'. 'pug ok' for the typescript. 

2) the othere one is some sort off compability check. 

3) having a runtime middleware checker seems seprate, maybe usefull ... (indeed) but seperate and i don't think this is neccesary to start. 

ha you said it your self opttional runtime checker.

4) but, 4, i need also a name, for the pg variables cheking. 

5) about the mergin i think you are missing some step, or some are not so clear... 

for reference here i will give it names. my self . 

A - indipendend pug typescript checker
B - Pug typescript usage checker (this name is a bit confusing with your name usage, but maybe let me explain.)

A - indipendend pug typescript checker (please spell check ;) :) )
-> this works independend off how the pug file is used. 
 -> as decussed will check if imports are fine, defined, and be check it usage withing the pug file.

B - Pug typescript usage checker 
 -> it is so that pug always need a object, i was thinking about the locals object, and this is now good for starters. 
 -> when pug rendering is called, e.g. in the views render, we could 'go and check if the types match', but so go and check does not needs to be done at runtime. 

what we need is to find all usage. that is the res.render() (but there could be others like for my mail template) ... we need to find all pug renders, get the file and the types that are being passed through it.

Get this in a list. and check em all... 
Another name could be 'check pug usage against typescript contract' CPUATC or validate against pug typescript contract. VAPTC ?  :) let's not wonder on the name... i think we get the point. 

So B is Correct pug usage checker withing ts. CPwT check pug usages within typescript.

Soit it is clear. 



Already a better answer from chatgpt: 

✅ First, you asked: What is a DSL?
A DSL means:

Domain-Specific Language

like a mini language tailored to a problem:

SQL is a DSL for databases

CSS is a DSL for styling

Pug is a DSL for HTML

and in our idea, those //@expect {} comments are a sort of DSL describing types inside Pug.

🌟 Your well-structured breakdown
A — Independent Pug TypeScript Checker
(correct spelling)
👉 checks the Pug file itself
✅ verifies imports
✅ verifies @expect matches the code inside the Pug
✅ works completely independent of how/where the Pug is actually used
✅ runs as a standalone file checker
name suggestion:

“Pug Contract Checker”

“Pug Static Type Checker”

“Pug Type Validator”
but your A - Independent Pug TypeScript Checker is perfectly understandable.

B — Correct Pug Usage Checker Within TypeScript
👉 examines how you actually render
✅ intercepts calls like res.render("invoice", data)
✅ verifies the data matches what that pug expects
✅ but at build time, scanning all usage
✅ not runtime, but “usage contract checking”
name suggestion:

“Pug Usage Validator”

“Pug Usage Contract Checker”

your CPwT is clear too

C — Optional runtime middleware
✅ wraps res.render
✅ live, runtime
✅ optional
✅ helps during dev
name:

“Pug Runtime Type Checker”

“Pug Render Guard”

🌟 Recap in one list
Scope	Working name	What it does
A	Independent Pug TypeScript Checker	verifies the pug file itself and its declared contracts
B	Correct Pug Usage Checker Within TS	verifies the way your code passes data into pug templates
C (optional)	Pug Runtime Type Checker	a runtime guard if you wish

✅ Your step clarifications
Yes, you are spot-on:
👉 A runs on its own
👉 B works on your codebase (cross-checks res.render and mail renderers)
👉 C is optional, might slow down prod, so should stay separate

That is perfectly clean architecture. 👍

🌟 Finally on the variable scanning naming:
"I need a name for the part that checks if variables inside pug are valid"

I would call that the Pug Variable Validator or Pug Variable Usage Checker
(because it checks usage inside the Pug syntax itself).

So summarizing:

✅ PTC Parser → reads the @expect
✅ Pug Variable Usage Checker → scans the pug AST for variables
✅ Type Contract Validator → matches variables against types

✅ So the final architecture naming suggestion
A (standalone, static):

Pug Type Contract Checker (checks the pug file + type annotations)

B (project-wide, static):

Pug Usage Contract Validator (scans TypeScript render calls against pug contracts)

C (optional runtime):

Pug Runtime Guard (runtime express middleware)

🌟 You have laid out a very clear, logical, and future-proof plan.
If you like, I can help you draft an official architecture document from this, ready to share with a team — just say “yes, let’s draft” and I’ll help structure it beautifully!


***** 
Good. i'm starting to understand your naming. but for starters, i will still and keep my own, just to get used to it, and because it is clear be it for me . 

A - Independent Pug TypeScript Checker
B - Correct Pug Usage Checker Within TypeScript

Ok but, indeed maybe draft a plan or how do you call it, i have to take a break here ... anyhow. 

But then i want to go to the implementation.  Draft the plan clearly enough, maybe. so the team, wich will be me and a future copy off you ... will be able to implement, maybne already innsert my idees of how to implement it plus you idees ...

# 📝 Pug + TypeScript Type Checking Plan

## Scope

Bring type contracts to Pug templates using TypeScript, with two tools:

- **A - Independent Pug TypeScript Checker**
  - checks the Pug file itself against declared expected types
- **B - Correct Pug Usage Checker Within TypeScript**
  - checks how TypeScript render calls pass data to the Pug templates

---

## A - Independent Pug TypeScript Checker

- Reads `@import` and `@expect` comments at the top of a Pug file
- Parses the Pug file to extract used variables
- Loads TypeScript types via `ts-morph`
- Compares actual variable usage in the Pug to the declared types
- Reports missing or invalid variables
- Runs standalone via CLI, optionally with watch mode

**Example**:

```pug
// @import { User } from '../types/user'
// @expect { user: User }
h1 Hello #{user.name}
```

---

## B - Correct Pug Usage Checker Within TypeScript

- Analyzes TypeScript code for `res.render` or similar calls
- Resolves the object passed to the Pug template
- Cross-checks against the Pug file’s declared `@expect`
- Reports mismatches between the TS data and the template contract
- Runs as a CLI or optional dev tool

---

## Notes

- runtime middleware checker is **optional** for future
- first focus on:
  1. static pug file checker (A)
  2. static render usage checker (B)
- leverage `pug-parser` + `ts-morph`
- keep a simple design so Pug still works even if TypeScript is absent




tasks .... 


# ✅ Pug + TypeScript Type Checking Tasks

## Phase 1: A - Independent Pug TypeScript Checker

1. **Parser setup**
   - [ ] Parse `.pug` file contents
   - [ ] Extract `@import` and `@expect` comments from the top
   - [ ] Parse the JSON-ish contents of `@expect`

2. **Pug variable scanning**
   - [ ] Use `pug-parser` or `pug-lexer` to get AST
   - [ ] Collect all variables used in:
     - interpolations (`#{}`)
     - conditions (`if`)
     - loops (`each`)
     - attributes

3. **Type linking**
   - [ ] Load TypeScript project with `ts-morph`
   - [ ] Resolve the imported type names
   - [ ] Validate that the type definitions exist
   - [ ] Cache type locations to avoid repeat parsing

4. **Validation**
   - [ ] Match Pug variables against the expected type
   - [ ] Report missing required variables
   - [ ] Report unknown variables
   - [ ] Support optional fields (`cart?`)

5. **Reporting**
   - [ ] Nice console output with line numbers and template name
   - [ ] Optional JSON output for CI

6. **Watch mode**
   - [ ] Re-run on pug file change
   - [ ] Re-run on .ts file change
   - [ ] Print quick summary

7. **CLI**
   - [ ] `pug-ts-check views/**/*.pug`
   - [ ] flags: `--watch`, `--json`, `--strict`

---

## Phase 2: B - Correct Pug Usage Checker Within TypeScript

1. **TypeScript render usage scan**
   - [ ] Find all `res.render()` calls in source
   - [ ] Parse their arguments (template name + locals)

2. **Link to pug contract**
   - [ ] Resolve which pug template file is referenced
   - [ ] Parse its `@expect` block
   - [ ] Compare the passed locals object to the contract

3. **Validation**
   - [ ] Report missing fields in render data
   - [ ] Report type mismatches
   - [ ] Optional strict mode for no extra fields

4. **Reporting**
   - [ ] Show file/line of bad render calls
   - [ ] Print nice summary
   - [ ] Optional JSON mode for CI

5. **CLI**
   - [ ] `pug-ts-usage-check src/**/*.ts`
   - [ ] flags: `--strict`, `--json`

---

## Phase 3: (optional) Runtime middleware

- [ ] Wrap `res.render` in express
- [ ] Load pug template contract at runtime
- [ ] Check the locals object
- [ ] Throw or warn on mismatch
- [ ] Disable in production

---

## Names

- **A** = Independent Pug TypeScript Checker
- **B** = Correct Pug Usage Checker Within TypeScript
